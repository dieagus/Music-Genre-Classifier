Code and results of the program I coded for my Machine Learning final. I used a Naive Bayes classifier model trained on thousands of songs, lyrics, and genres to create a genre classifier. The code includes the creation, training, testing, and evaluation of the model accuracy. 

genre.ipynb is the Google Colab code
predictions.csv is a file of the results of the predictions from the model
